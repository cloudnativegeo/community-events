## Overview

**What:** Week long Zarr Sprint. Objectives include:

- finalizing implementation of critical Zarr v3 features, including variable chunk grids, sharding, and codec extensions
- ensuring cross-language compatibility across Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Rust, Julia, and R
- providing hands-on guidance to major adopters, including the European Space Agency (ESA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other international organizations
- creating a roadmap for community-driven development.

We expect to produce a finalized extension for variable chunk grids, a robust, performant sharding implementation, migration guides, best practices documentation, a community roadmap, and a follow-up webinar and blog post to further enable open science using Zarr.

**When:** October 13-17, 2025.

Detailed agenda to come.

**Where:** Rome, Italy.
